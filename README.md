# Clean_And_Analyze_Employee_Exit_Surveys
For this project, I was interested in 2 institutes and came across their datasets in the public domain - `Department of Education, Training and Employment` (DETE) and the `Technical and Further Education` (TAFE) institute in Queensland, Australia. I wanted to know whether 1. Employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time were resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction. Also, what about experienced, established and veteran employees, who have been there longer? 2. Younger employees were resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction. Also, what about older employees?
